  copy the certificate authority data from the config file
  #lets decome the ca certificte
  200  echo LS0tLS1CRUdJTi | base64 -d
  #store the ca certificate in a file

  ##finalyl we will store the key file 
  echo LS0tLS1CRUdJTiBSU0E | base64 -d > key
  ###once you got ca crt and key
  #lets get the server address using 
  root@k8s-master-node:~# curl https://10.128.0.9:6443
